Palindrome 1
Maximum number of files: 1
Type of work: Individual work
Problem specification
A palindrome is a sequence of value that reads the same either from left to right or from right to left. 


For example the following is a palindrome.

1 4 6 7 6 4 1

The following is NOT a palindrome.
1 2 3 4
Implement the following function 
bool is_palindrome(int[], int);
That returns true if the integer array in the first input parameter is a palindrome, false otherwise. 
The second input parameter is the size of the array.
Input specification
1. An integer n, followed by

2. n integers

Output specification
Your program should output the following if the sequence of n integers form a palindrome  (according to the order they are input to the program)

This is a palindrome.
Otherwise, output

This is NOT a palindrome.
 You can assume that the input are all valid.
