The system supports 4 commands:

·        PURCHASE X P – Specifies customer X purchases product P.

·        HISTORY X P – Outputs the number of times customer X has purchased product P.

·        SIMILAR X Y – Outputs “Yes” if there is 2 or more common distinct products purchased among customer X and Y. You can assume customers X and Y exist.

·        SUGGEST X P - Output “Yes” if there is another user Y such that

o   X and Y are similar, and

o   Y purchased product P but X did not.

You may follow the given template purchase.cpp or you can write a new program.
